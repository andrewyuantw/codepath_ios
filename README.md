# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator*

**Tipsy** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Andrew Yuan**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [X] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

## Notes

I had some initial trouble linking my Github account with Xcode, but the app development so far has been fun. I also had some trouble referencing variables in the ViewController from the AppDelegate but I was able to fix that as well.
